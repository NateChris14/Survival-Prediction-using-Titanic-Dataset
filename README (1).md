# Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features using a machine learning technique. The dataset is sourced from the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

### Project Structure

- Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation for the Titanic survival prediction task.

- Data: The Titanic dataset used in this project, typically available from Kaggle or preloaded in the notebook.

### Requirements

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary libraries such as:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:



```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file based on the libraries used in your notebook. You can generate it using pip freeze.)

### How to Run

- Clone this repository or download the .ipynb file.
- Ensure that the dataset is loaded and available within the notebook (the dataset should either be linked or included in the project folder).
- Open the Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all cells sequentially to execute the code.

### Data Description

The dataset contains the following key features:

- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- Name: Name of the passenger.
- Sex: Gender of the passenger.
- Age: Age of the passenger.
- SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- Parch: Number of parents or children aboard.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
- Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.
- Cabin: Cabin number (if available).
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- Survived: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

### Analysis and Methodology

The notebook performs the following steps:

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***:

Visualization of data distribution and relationships between features using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Handling of missing data (e.g., missing age or cabin information).

***Feature Engineering***:

Transforming categorical features (e.g., converting "Sex" to numerical values).
Creating new features or adjusting existing ones to improve model performance.

***Model Selection and Training***:

Application of Logistic Regression,
Tuning hyperparameters and evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

***Model Evaluation***:

Confusion matrix and other relevant metrics to assess model accuracy.

### Results

The model is evaluated based on its performance in predicting Titanic survival. The key findings and results of the best model will be highlighted in the notebook.
